    Welcome to Stay Home Moon! You’ve found yourself in a bit of a spot,\n 
    haven’t you? The goal of the game is pretty simple: Don’t Eat Your Friends.

    You will have to navigate a series of phone calls with your friends. 
    You’ll be presented with a series of responses that will shape how your 
    friend reacts to the conversation. You will select your response by typing 
    the correlating number into the command line. There are three things to 
    remember when selecting a response:

    -Your words have weight.
    -Some of your options will have a greater impact than others.
    -The ultimate goal is to not eat your friends, but try not to completely 
     ruin your relationships.

    Your goal is to keep your friendship points between 0.25 and 0.75. 
    If you manage this by the last question, and the value is in that interval 
                                   you win!

                                   Be Warned -
        if it ever falls to 0, or makes it to 1, the game will end immediatly.

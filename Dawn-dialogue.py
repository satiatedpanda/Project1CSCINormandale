print("""Welcome to Stay Home Moon! You’ve found yourself in a bit of a spot, 
haven’t you? The goal of the game is pretty simple: Don’t Eat Your Friends.

You will have to navigate a series of phone calls with your friends. You’ll
be presented with a series of responses that will shape how your friend reacts 
to the conversation. You will select your response by typing the correlating 
number into the command line. There are three things to remember when selecting
a response:

-Your words have weight.
-Some of your options will have a greater impact than others.
-The ultimate goal is to not eat your friends, but try not to completely ruin 
 your relationships.

You should really pick up that phone now, Cameron’s waiting, good luck!""")
